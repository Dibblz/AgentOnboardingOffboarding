- **Salesforce**
- **OneLogin**
- **Agent Hierarchy Portal**

## Functionality

- Parses required agent information directly from an open ServiceNow ticket in the browser.
- Automates form population and submission in Salesforce to create the agent account.
- Creates the corresponding user account in OneLogin with appropriate attributes.
- Updates the Agent Hierarchy system to reflect the new agent's presence and reporting structure.

## How to Run

2. Launch the flow from Power Automate Desktop.
